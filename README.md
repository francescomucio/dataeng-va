## Intro
Welcome to this small collection of utilities for data people. 
    
I started putting together this out of my daily life dealing with dbt, sql and Airflow. I hope you will find it useful and they will help you to save time.

## How to use this
Just add your [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) key and start exploring.

Ideally you should just select a page, the help you need and use the form. Some times there are some "Advanced settings" to specify additional info or flags you want to apply.

## Caveat Emptor
As you probably can imagine, these utilities are based on ChatGPT which sometimes can say more than expected. Please be careful and review the answers you receive.
